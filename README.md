## Blaze

<!-- /statamic:hide -->

Blaze is a super-fast command palette for the Statamic Control Panel - linking you to entries, collections, nav items & documentation. <!-- statamic:hide --> [**Watch a short demo video**](https://www.loom.com/share/921195d9d2074811af4ba1179623008b) <!-- /statamic:hide -->

## Installation

Installing Blaze is simple! All you need to do is require Blaze as a Composer dependency:

```
composer require doublethreedigital/blaze
```

Now, you should be able to open up Blaze with `âŒ˜ P` (or `Ctrl P` on Windows)

## Documentation

Review the documentation on the [Statamic Marketplace](https://statamic.com/addons/double-three-digital/blaze/docs).

## Support

Blaze is a free addon, because of this there is no direct support channel. If you have a feature request or experience a bug, please [open a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/doublethreedigital/blaze/issues/new/choose) and it'll be looked into over the next week or two.

> Only the latest version of this addon is supported. If you open a bug report using an old version, your issue will be closed.

## Sponsor me!

Some of my addons (including this one) are free & open-source, meaning you can use them in your site without buying any licenses.

However, there is a cost from my perspective to maintain this addon (fixing new bugs, adding new features, answering questions). That all takes time. I've spent over **19 hours** of my own time maintaining this addon over the past year.

If you use this software on your projects & can afford it, I'd appreciate it if you'd consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/duncanmcclean), even if it's just a couple dollars a month.
