## Blaze

<!-- /statamic:hide -->

Blaze is a super-fast command palette for the Statamic Control Panel - linking you to entries, collections, nav items & documentation. <!-- statamic:hide --> [**Watch a short demo video**](https://www.loom.com/share/921195d9d2074811af4ba1179623008b) <!-- /statamic:hide -->

## Installation

Installing Blaze is simple! All you need to do is require Blaze as a Composer dependency:

```
composer require doublethreedigital/blaze
```

Now, you should be able to open up Blaze with `âŒ˜ P` (or `Ctrl P` on Windows)

## Documentation

Read the documentation over on the [Statamic Marketplace](https://statamic.com/addons/double-three-digital/blaze/docs).

## Sponsor Duncan

This addon is open-source, meaning anyone can use this addon in their sites for **free**!

However, maintaining and developing new features for open-source projects can take quite a bit of time. If you're using Blaze in your production environment, please [consider sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/duncanmcclean) (Duncan McClean) for a couple dollars a month.

## Security

Only the latest version of Blaze (v1.1) will receive security updates if a vulnerability is found.

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to Duncan straight away, [via email](mailto:security@doublethree.digital). Please don't report security issues through GitHub Issues.
